    "text": "Measurement of the two distinct components—scattering and absorption—of a single particle’s optical extinction provides fundamentally important and complementary information on how that object processes light: either scattering it back to the far-field or converting it into internal excitation. Yet measurement and separation of each is an extraordinarily difficult experimental task. Far-field optical spectroscopies and microscopies are also limited by diffraction, which further restricts the amount of information attainable. In spite of these constraints, we combine ideas from photothermal heterodyne imaging and plasmon-enhanced super-resolution imaging to correlate the absorption spectra of individual nanoscopic objects with their precise locations below the diffraction limit. Active far-field manipulation and control of the thermal near-field in engineered metamaterials extends this work in new directions that we are currently exploring in collaboration with multiple experimental teams."

Touching a hot pan’s lid provides a simple and all too familiar example of such thermal conduction. As a material’s size is reduced to 10-100s of nanometers, or about 1,000 times smaller than a human hair, depositing and maintaining thermal energy within a small region of space becomes even more challenging. Yet the ability to control heat flow and thus temperature at nanoscopic dimensions has important implications for applications ranging from data storage and local chemical reaction control to photothermal therapies for disease treatment and pain management through ion channel stimulation.\nWith support from the National Science Foundation Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) Program, Professor David J. Masiello from the University of Washington, Professor Katherine A. Willets from Temple University, and Professor Stephan Link from Rice University are developing methods to theoretically design and experimentally realize a new class of materials capable of controllably directing temperature increases to nanoscale regions of space using light. Beyond impacting a wide variety of applications, the project is also facilitating the interdisciplinary training of students and postdoctoral researchers through student exchange between the three research groups.",

    "text": "Pushing the boundaries of fast electron spectroscopy, energy-monochromated and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopes have opened the far infrared to nanometer scale spatial mapping. Together with experiment, we leverage these advances to resolve open fundamental questions in nano-spectroscopy, perform entirely new materials characterization techniques at the single-particle level, and discover advanced materials endowed with unprecedented functionalities."

    "text": "Coupling between light and matter is extraordinarily weak. Optical resonator cavities provide an opportunity to coax repeated light-matter interactions, thereby enhancing coupling far beyond that of free space. In such settings, coupling can be so strong that it is no longer possible to disentangle the original optical and material degrees of freedom, resulting in non-equilibrium quantum optical states endowed with properties beyond those of their components. Together with experiment we develop theoretical models and simulation tools necessary to explicitly connect nanophotonic cavity + qubit systems with quantum many-body processes and phenomena. Our work not only enables the simulation of quantum many-body physics in nanophotonic devices but also provides opportunities to protect fragile quantum correlations against decoherence."
